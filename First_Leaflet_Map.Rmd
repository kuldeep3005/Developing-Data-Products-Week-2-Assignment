## Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

This map shows all cities of world. cities data taken from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities.

``` {r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

df <- read.csv("worldcities.csv")
df %>% leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    lat = df$lat, 
    lng = df$lng, 
    popup = paste(df$popup, "<br>", "City:", df$city_ascii),
    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
